======

HyperGraphQL is a [GraphQL](http://graphql.org) interface for querying and serving [linked data](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data) on the Web. It is designed to support federated querying and exposing data from multiple linked data services using GraphQL query language and schemas. The basic response format is [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org), which extends the standard JSON with the [JSON-LD context](https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld-api-best-practices/#dfn-json-ld-context) enabling semantic disambiguation of the contained data.
